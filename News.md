Hanglin Ye presented her work at the 14th U.S. National Congress on Computational Mechanics (USNCCM14). The presentation was about studying the changes in mechanical properties of soft tissue with respect to different extent of burns. The results show that the burnt tissue has a more linear stress-strain response than that of non-burnt tissue.
