Burns are some of the most common injuries in both civilian and combat scenarios. Prompt
and proper treatments largely depend on an accurate diagnosis of burn depth.  However, a major
knowledge gap exists in quantitative characterization and understanding of changes in intrinsic
mechanical properties, as a result of the burning process. This thesis provides insights into the mechanics and morphology of tissues subjected to thermal injury.
