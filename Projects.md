Burns are some of the most common injuries in both civilian and combat scenarios. Prompt
and proper treatments largely depend on an accurate diagnosis of burn depth.  However, a major
knowledge gap exists in quantitative characterization and understanding of changes in intrinsic
mechanical properties, as a result of the burning process. This thesis provides insights into the mechanics and morphology of tissues subjected to thermal injury.

</center>

Ultrasound imaging has been shown to have limitation in detecting burn severities, both in accuracy and in efficiency.This research ultilizes ultrasound imaging-based classification approach, in conjunction with the grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) texture features to classify burn degrees, providing an accuracy of **~99%**.

### Burn Degree Classification with Raman Spectra

In this study, we demonstrate the feasibility of using Raman spectroscopy alone to classify burn severities. Using kernel support vector machine (KSVM) with features extracted from the Raman spectra by principal component analysis (PCA), and partial least-square (PLS), an average accuracy of **~92%** is achieved, validated by independent accessment.

How realistic are the man-made skins? Can they be proper substitues for real skins? This study demonstrates that there is a significant difference between real skin and man-made skins in terms of mechanical properties, using ANOVA and linear discriminat analysis (LDA).

Mechanical properties can be an helpful indicator about tissue abnormalities, _e.g._ burns. This study characterizes the changes of mechanical properties in burnt tissues with increasing burn dergees, with ultrasound elastography (inverse optimization) technique.

Understanding the changes of collagen structure in burnt tissue is important for burn assessment. This study utilizes Raman spectroscopy to analyze the burn-induced collagen conformational changes in burnt skin tissue, revealing the the changes of protein and amino acids that may explain the softening of mechanical response.
