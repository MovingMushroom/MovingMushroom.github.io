### Ph.D. Thesis: Mechanical and Morphological Alternations in Skin Tissue due to Thermal Injury
Burns are some of the most common injuries in both civilian and combat scenarios. Prompt
and proper treatments largely depend on an accurate diagnosis of burn depth.  However, a major
knowledge gap exists in quantitative characterization and understanding of changes in intrinsic
mechanical properties, as a result of the burning process. This thesis provides insights into the mechanics and morphology of tissues subjected to thermal injury by: 
1. Characterization of changes in mechanical properties of burnt tissues
2. Classifying different burn severities with altered mechanical properties of burnt tissues
3. Analyzing the burn-induced collagen conformational changes that lead to changes of mechanical
properties
4. Classifying different burn severities with Raman spectra.

The knowledge obtained in these studies can facilitate the diagnosis and treatment process of burn injuries.
